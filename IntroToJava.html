    <p class="AboutMe">
      My name is Nikhil and I am a freshman at Rutgers University majoring in Computer Science.
      I like to code because I am passionate about understanding the concepts of software. 
      I can code in Java, some Python, and a bit of HTML. I chose Computer Science as my major 
      because I like communicating with a computer to get my ideas right. There is a lot of math 
      involved in code, and it can be a bit frustrating, but math is essential to computer science. 
      As you learn more about Java in this website, there will be many functions/methods which require 
      prior experience of math. Just like math, CS is part of our everyday lives. For example, a thermostat 
      represents a function which regulates the temperature. With all of this considered, my main goal is to 
      engage in the field of Computer Science and treat it as a recreational activity.

    <h1 class = "section-cs">What is Computer Science?</h1>
    <p>Most people think computer science is all about code, however that isn't true. Computer Science 
      involves problem solving, and that skill can not only lead one to jobs, but can also create an 
      interest in learning the profession. Problem solving is the most efficient way of expressing your 
      idea, but to do that you need an algorithm. <br> <br> What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a set of steps
      that is used to solve a problem. For example, to make oatmeal, you have to boil the milk then put oats.
      After that, wait for a while to cool down and then add your favorite toppings. This method of solving
      problems may seem hard at first, however it will lead you to the right path. This process has helped me 
      program more efficiently even throughout learning the basics of JAVA.</p>
