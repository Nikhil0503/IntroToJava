    <p class="AboutMe"> <a href="#AboutMe"></a>
      My name is Nikhil Munagala and I am a freshman at Rutgers University majoring in Computer Science.
      I am passionate about coding and learning various programming languages so that I can be more engaged in the
      world of computer Science. I chose Computer Science as my major because I want to learn how to code so 
      that I can improve my problem solving skills. Before taking Intro to CS, I had no prior coding experience.
      I wanted to figure out a way to learn programming languages but at the same time challenge myself to design 
      solutions to problems using logic. There can be a lot of theory and logic involved in code, and it can be 
      a bit frustrating, but it is essential to computer science. As you learn more about Java in this website, there will be many 
      functions/methods which require prior experience of math. Just like math, CS is part of our everyday 
      lives. For example, a thermostat represents a function which regulates the temperature in degrees 
      Fahrenheit or Celsius. With all of this considered, my main goal is to pursue a career in Computer
      Science in the future.

    <h1 class = "section-cs">What is Computer Science?</h1>
    <p>Most people think computer science is all about code, however that isn't true. Computer Science 
      involves problem solving, and that skill cannot only lead one to jobs, but can also create an 
      interest in learning the profession. Problem solving is the most efficient way of expressing your 
      idea, but to do that you need an algorithm. <br> <br> What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a set of steps
      that is used to solve a problem. For example, to make oatmeal, you have to boil the milk then put oats.
      After that, wait for a while to cool down and then add your favorite toppings. This method of solving
      problems may seem hard at first, however it will lead you to the right path. This process has helped me 
      program more efficiently even throughout learning the basics of JAVA.</p>
