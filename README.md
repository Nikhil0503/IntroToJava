# IntroToJava
My IntroToJava Website covers about the fundamental concepts of Java which I have learned in Intro to CS in Rutgers. In this website, we will cover the basics of the Java programming language in which you will apply what you've learned to create small programming projects. 
I built this website using HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. I am currently learning Java and Javascript. 
Unfortunatlely, I didn't do a backend for my contact form, because I needed to learn SQL or Javascript extensively to create a contact form, so I decided to send a message to email/call me instead.
